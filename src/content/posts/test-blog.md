# I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.

File not found. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Tell them I hate them. Can I use the gun?

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Shut up and get to the point! You, minion. Lift my arm.**AFTER HIM!***Moving along… In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!*Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

## But existing is basically all I do!

Soon enough. But I've never been to the moon! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

1. I never loved you.
2. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
3. We're also Santa Claus!

### Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

I never loved you. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Hey, whatcha watching? I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that.

* Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
* Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
* As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.
